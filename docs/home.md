## Concepts & URLs

First, you'll have to deal with a **Seller** object, you can retrieve and create one with those URLs and parameters:

* [/sellers/](/sellers): `GET`, `POST` (parameters: `uuid`)
* [/sellers/{uuid}/](/sellers/{uuid}): `GET`

*Note: the documentation uses [URL Templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_Template) to include dynamic parameters. You can follow those links to get additional information about a particular URL.*
