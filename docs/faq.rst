Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* Is there a difference between purchasing an app and an in-app payments?

** Not to zippy. The flow of doing an app vs. in-app payment is different in
that they orginate and are fulfilled differently. However by the time the
flow has reached zippy, they are the same. Zippy's job is just to process the
payment. Most of the work for handling the difference is done in Webpay if you
are curious.
